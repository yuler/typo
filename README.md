# typo

A desktop tool that helps improve English writing through AI-powered suggestions and corrections.

## Ideas

- Use [tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/) to build a desktop app.
- The main interaction is at the system level, adding a hotkey that, after text selection, sends the content to AI to help optimize my input and explain any errors.

## Features

- Custom Shortcuts for invoke popup page


## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev
```
